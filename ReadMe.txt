Dear Reader,

Welcome to my machine learning portfolio: a collection of selected projects from selected machine-learning-related courses I have taken during my PhD at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 

The idea is to succinctly demonstrate to job recruiters that I can code in R, MATLAB, and Python (Tensorflow); and to show that I have sufficient understanding of the fundamental machine learning algorithms so as to be able to implement them by hand i.e. without using built-in packages.

Each folder in the main directory is named according to the name of the class whose projects it contains.  
In each class folder are sub-folders named according to project.  
Within each project folder, a formal summary of the implementation and results can be found in "Report.pdf", and the rest of the files are either code or data.  
Some project folders don't include data either because the data is proprietary or because the data file format was incompatible with GitHub.

All the best,

Andr√©s
